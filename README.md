Welcome to AInvestors!


This project allows any user to input a trading strategy in text format, for example, "A mean reversion strategy that uses a long moving average of 200 days and a short moving average of 50 days, please test the strategy on the S&P, DOW, Apple, and Amazon from 2010-01-01 to 2019-12-31."

The project then uses an OpenAI API (to be fine tuned) to create a strategy program that can backtest the strategy the user provided.

The project will output the results of the program, showing how the user's strategy would have done if it was implemented during the backtesting period. 

These detailed insights allow users to truly expand the capabilities of their strategies and learn more about the performances of various strategies so they can choose one that suits their goals!
